  <p>
  ALPHAHUB SIGNALS LLC cannot and does not represent or guarantee that any of
  the information available through the Services or on ALPHAHUB SIGNALS LLC is
  accurate, reliable, current, complete or appropriate for your needs. Various
  information available through the Services or on ALPHAHUB SIGNALS LLC may be
  specially obtained by ALPHAHUB SIGNALS LLC from professional businesses or
  organizations, such as exchanges, news providers, market data providers and
  other content providers, who are believed to be sources of reliable
  information (collectively, the “Data Providers”). Nevertheless, due to
  various factors — including the inherent possibility of human and mechanical
  error — the accuracy, completeness, timeliness, results obtained from use,
  and correct sequencing of information available through the Services and
  Website are not and cannot be guaranteed by ALPHAHUB SIGNALS LLC.  Neither
  ALPHAHUB SIGNALS LLC nor its affiliates make any express or implied
  warranties (including, without limitation, any warranty or merchantability or

<section id="investment-disclaimer">
  <h3>Disclaimer Regarding Investment Decisions and Trading</h3>
  <p>
  Decisions to buy, sell, hold or trade in securities, commodities and other
  investments involve risk and are best made based on the advice of qualified
  financial professionals. Any trading in securities or other investments
  involves a risk of substantial losses. The practice of “Day Trading” involves
  particularly high risks and can cause you to lose substantial sums of money.
  Before undertaking any trading program, you should consult a qualified
  financial professional. Please consider carefully whether such trading is
  suitable for you in light of your financial condition and ability to bear
  financial risks. Under no circumstances shall we be liable for any loss or
  damage you or anyone else incurs as a result of any trading or investment
  activity that you or anyone else engages in based on any information or
  material you receive through ALPHAHUB SIGNALS LLC or our Services.
  </p>
  <p>
  Trading in the financial markets and securities in stocks, bonds, exchange
  traded funds, mutual funds, and money market funds involve substantial risk
  and PARTICIPANTS CAN LOSE A LOT OF MONEY, and thus is not appropriate for
  everyone. You should carefully consider your financial condition before
  trading in these markets, and only expendable risk capital should be used.
  </p>
</section>
<hr>
<section id="performance-disclaimer">
  <h3>Disclaimer Regarding Hypothetical Performance Results</h3>
  <p>
  Hypothetical performance results have many inherent limitations, some of
  which are mentioned below. No representation is being made that any account
  will or is likely to achieve profits or losses similar to those shown. In
  fact, there are frequently sharp differences between hypothetical performance
  results and actual results subsequently achieved by any particular trading
  program.
  </p>
  <p>
  One of the limitations of hypothetical performance results is that they are
  generally prepared with the benefit of hindsight. In addition, hypothetical
  trading does not involve financial risk and no hypothetical trading record
  can completely account for the impact of financial risk in actual trading.
  For example the ability to withstand losses or to adhere to a particular
  trading program in spite of the trading losses are material points, which can
  also adversely affect trading results.  There are numerous other factors
  related to the market in general or to the implementation of any specific
  trading program which cannot be fully accounted for in the preparation of
  hypothetical performance results and all of which can adversely affect actual
  trading results.
  </p>
  <p>
  THE SITE AND CONTENT ARE PROVIDED “AS IS”, ANY CONTENT FROM ALPHAHUB SIGNALS
  LLC PRODUCTS AND SERVICES ARE PROVIDED FOR EDUCATIONAL PURPOSES ONLY AND DO
  NOT CONSTITUTE AS INVESTMENT ADVICE. ANY TRADES PLACED UP UPON RELIANCE ON
  ALPHAHUB SIGNALS LLC (ALPHAHUB.US) SYSTEMS ARE TAKEN AT YOUR OWN RISK FOR
  YOUR OWN ACCOUNT. PAST PERFORMANCE DOES NOT GUARANTEE FUTURE RESULTS. WHILE
  THERE IS GREAT POTENTIAL FOR REWARD TRADING IN THE FINANCIAL MARKETS, THERE
  IS ALSO SUBSTANTIAL RISK OF LOSS IN ALL TRADING.
  </p>
  <p>
  YOU MUST DECIDE YOUR OWN SUITABILITY TO PLACE A TRADE OR NOT. PERFORMANCE IN
  THE FINANCIAL MARKETS CAN NEVER BE GUARANTEED.  ALPHAHUB SIGNALS LLC AND ANY
