          Disclaimer Regarding Investment Decisions and Trading
        </Title>
        <p>
          Decisions to buy, sell, hold or trade in securities, commodities and
          other investments involve risk and are best made based on the advice
          of qualified financial professionals. Any trading in securities or
          other investments involves a risk of substantial losses. The practice
          of “Day Trading” involves particularly high risks and can cause you to
          lose substantial sums of money. Before undertaking any trading
          program, you should consult a qualified financial professional. Please
          consider carefully whether such trading is suitable for you in light
          of your financial condition and ability to bear financial risks. Under
          no circumstances shall we be liable for any loss or damage you or
          anyone else incurs as a result of any trading or investment activity
          that you or anyone else engages in based on any information or
          material you receive through FORCEPU.SH or our Services.
        </p>
        <p>
          Trading in the financial markets and securities in stocks, bonds,
          exchange traded funds, mutual funds, and money market funds involve
          substantial risk and PARTICIPANTS CAN LOSE A LOT OF MONEY, and thus is
          not appropriate for everyone. You should carefully consider your
          financial condition before trading in these markets, and only
          expendable risk capital should be used.

      <section id="performance-disclaimer">
        <Title level={sublevel}>
          Disclaimer Regarding Hypothetical Performance Results
        </Title>
        <p>
          Hypothetical performance results have many inherent limitations, some
          of which are mentioned below. No representation is being made that any
          account will or is likely to achieve profits or losses similar to
          those shown. In fact, there are frequently sharp differences between
          hypothetical performance results and actual results subsequently
          achieved by any particular trading program.
        </p>
        <p>
          One of the limitations of hypothetical performance results is that
          they are generally prepared with the benefit of hindsight. In
          addition, hypothetical trading does not involve financial risk and no
          hypothetical trading record can completely account for the impact of
          financial risk in actual trading. For example the ability to withstand
          losses or to adhere to a particular trading program in spite of the
          trading losses are material points, which can also adversely affect
          trading results. There are numerous other factors related to the
          market in general or to the implementation of any specific trading
          program which cannot be fully accounted for in the preparation of
          hypothetical performance results and all of which can adversely affect
          actual trading results.

          In the event of an interruption of service lasting five consecutive
          days or longer, FORCEPU.SH agrees to offer applicable subscribers the
          following compensation options:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            a complementary extension of access to their FORCEPU.SH algorithm's
            signals for a period of time equaled to the interruption period
          </li>
          <li>
            a refund pro-rated for the remainder of the subscription period.
            Choosing this option will cancel the subscriber's existing
            subscription for the remainder of the subscription period.
          </li>
          <li>
            a switch to an alternative subscriber-approved FORCEPU.SH algorithm
            for the rest of the subscriber's subscription period — plus the
            length of the interruption — at no cost. After that, the subscriber
            may remain subscribed to the alternative algorithm at that
            algorithm's indicated fee.

          subscribers via FORCEPU.SH communication channels, e.g. email,
          encouraging them to take action. The discontinued algorithm will no
          longer accept new subscribers, and continue publishing signals until
          all existing subscribers' subscription periods have expired, at which
          point signal publishing will stop.

        <p>
          Alternatively, FORCEPU.SH offers applicable subscribers the following
